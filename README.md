V1.0

The purpose of this application is a one stop shop for tracking metrics and events in a list, allowing multiple layers of a site's manufacturing meetings to view data seamlessly and cascade information upwards.
Each pillar will show its own tracking list and mark the respective day of month red if there is an event/escalation as well as a 2nd section for tracking metrics.

Compile using pyinstaller and run as exe, store in a common drive in your business network.

Database is stored as csv for quick access from laymen, however since its imported via pandas can be ported in from SQL easily.

This GUI template should serve as a base for your future expansion and purpose. Enjoy! 

See import list for dependencies.
